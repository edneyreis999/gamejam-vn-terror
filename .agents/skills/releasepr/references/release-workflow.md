## The three stages

1. **Release PR** — on normal pushes to the default branch, pr-release computes
   the next version and opens/updates a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch + pull request
   containing the version bumps, changelog, and release body.
2. **Dry-run validation** — when that release PR is opened/updated, a CI job
   runs `pr-release dry-run` to validate the release end-to-end without
   publishing.
3. **Production release** — when the release PR merges, the merge commit (whose
   subject starts with `release:` or `ci(release):`) triggers tagging and a
   GoReleaser publish.

## What triggers the release-PR job

On push to the default branch, the job runs **unless** the head commit subject
starts with `release:`, `ci(release):`, or `Merge pull request`, or the commit
author is `github-actions[bot]`. It also runs on manual dispatch with mode
`release-pr`. This is why ordinary `feat:` / `fix:` commits produce a release PR
but the release commit itself does not loop.

## What the release-PR job produces

After `pr-release pr-release --enable-rollback --ci-output`, CI inspects the
current branch. If it matches `^release/v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+`, a release PR
exists and follow-up checks (CI + a dispatched dry-run) are triggered.
If no release branch was produced (no conventional changes since the last tag),
the job reports "No release PR branch produced" and stops — this is expected,
not a failure. Force one with `--force` (or the workflow's `force_release`
dispatch input).

## What triggers the dry-run job

The dry-run job runs when a pull request whose title starts with
`release: Release ` or `ci(release): Release ` is opened/synchronized/reopened
against the default branch, or on manual dispatch with mode `dry-run` (passing
`head_ref` and `pr_number`).

## pr-release does not tag or publish

pr-release's responsibility ends at the opened/updated release PR. It does
**not** create git tags and does not publish releases. Tagging and publishing
are the consuming repo's own release job (below). Do not expect a tag to appear
just from running `pr-release pr-release`.

## What triggers the production release

A push to the default branch whose head commit subject starts with `release:`
or `ci(release):` — i.e. the release PR being merged. The consumer's release
job (not pr-release) then:

1. Derives the version with `git cliff --bumped-version` (fallback: parse it
   from the commit subject `Release vX.Y.Z`).
2. Creates and pushes an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z`.
3. Runs GoReleaser with
   `--release-notes=RELEASE_BODY.md`,
   `--release-header-tmpl=.goreleaser.release-header.md.tmpl`,
   `--release-footer-tmpl=.goreleaser.release-footer.md.tmpl`.

Do not hand-author `release:` commits on the default branch — that is the
trigger that publishes a production release.

## Explicit beta, stable, and legacy releases

Use `pr-release plan` when a manual workflow supplies an authoritative ref,
version, and channel. This path is separate from the conventional-commit
release-PR version calculation:

1. Checkout the supplied ref with full history and tags.
2. Run `plan --ref ... --version ... --channel ... --format github` and append
   its stdout to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.
3. Run `release-body` with the emitted `release_tag` and `release_git_range`,
   writing stdout to a temporary Markdown file. Pass `--initial` only when the
   emitted `release_initial` is true; otherwise pass `--range`.
4. Run the project's dry-run checks using the emitted unprefixed version and
   publication policy.
5. Only the consuming workflow creates the emitted tag and invokes GoReleaser,
   npm, and Homebrew. The release publisher and any changelog receipt generator
   consume the same planned predecessor and range; only the release publisher
   consumes the temporary Markdown file.

The plan proves that the supplied ref is the checked-out `HEAD` and that the
derived tag is absent locally and on `origin`. Read the `plan` channel-policy
table in `commands.md` before wiring the publishing steps; it is the single
source for GitHub, npm, and Homebrew behavior. A legacy branch or packaging
profile is owned by the consumer; pr-release never infers it from the channel
name.

Treat every plan output as authoritative. Shell code must not strip `v`, parse
commit subjects, rerun `git cliff --bumped-version`, or infer a channel from a
branch. The planner emits both the unprefixed version and its single `v`-tag so
the publishing steps can consume the correct form directly. It also emits the
nearest predecessor on the first-parent release line, the exact predecessor-
to-commit range, and explicit first-release intent. Beta plans include
prerelease predecessors; stable and legacy plans exclude them. Do not recompute
these values with `git describe` in the consuming workflow.

## Branch and PR naming

- Release branch: `release/vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Release PR title: `release: Release vX.Y.Z` (or `ci(release): Release vX.Y.Z`).
- These exact prefixes are matched by the CI `if:` conditions; renaming them
  breaks the dry-run and production-release triggers.

## RELEASE_BODY.md vs RELEASE_NOTES.md

- `RELEASE_BODY.md` — only the **current** release section; consumed by
  GoReleaser for the GitHub Release body.
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — the committed **historical** document; the current
  release is prepended while older sections are preserved.
- `.release-notes/` holds active custom notes (from `add-note`) folded into the
  body, then archived to `.release-notes/archive/vX.Y.Z/` once the release
  branch is prepared. A `.release-notes/.gitkeep` keeps the directory tracked.

## Mental model for debugging "why no release?"

Check in this order:
1. Were the commits conventional (`feat:`/`fix:`/etc.)? Non-conventional
   commits yield no version bump → no release PR. (`release-notes.md`)
2. Was the push commit one of the skipped kinds (bot / `release:` /
   `ci(release):` / `Merge pull request`)? Then the release-PR job did not run
   by design.
3. Did owner/repo and token resolve? (`configuration.md`,
   `troubleshooting.md`)
4. Did the release PR title keep the required prefix so the dry-run job fired?
5. Wrong/initial version? The checkout was likely shallow — require
   `fetch-depth: 0` + `fetch-tags: true`. For a tagless first release, set
   `INITIAL_VERSION`.
