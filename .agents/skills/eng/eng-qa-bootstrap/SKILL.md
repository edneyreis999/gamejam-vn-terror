# Compozy QA Bootstrap

Provision infrastructure and scratch evidence for one QA pass. Bootstrap does
not prove runtime behavior; downstream QA owns journeys and verdicts.

## Required Inputs

- **scenario-slug** (optional): short lab context; defaults to `release-candidate`.
- **--playbook <ref>**: required when called by `eng-real-scenario-qa`; omitted for generic `qa-execution` infrastructure.
- **--profile targeted --required-surface <surface>**: use for a bounded non-agent journey; repeat the surface flag for every CLI/API/Web/runtime/provider plane in scope.

## Procedure

**Step 1: Create or Resume One Lab**

1. Resolve the scenario slug and, for `eng-real-scenario-qa`, validate the playbook under `.agents/skills/eng/eng-real-scenario-qa/references/playbooks/`.
2. For a new pass, run the bootstrap helper (bootstrap, mutating):
   `python3 .agents/skills/eng/eng-qa-bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap-qa-env.py --scenario "<scenario-slug>" --repo-root . [--playbook "<ref>" | --profile targeted --required-surface "<surface>"]`
3. Reuse only when continuing the same active QA session or loop with its exact manifest:
   `python3 .agents/skills/eng/eng-qa-bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap-qa-env.py --scenario "<scenario-slug>" --repo-root . [--playbook "<ref>"] --reuse-manifest "<manifest-path>"`
4. Record the emitted `BOOTSTRAP_MANIFEST`; do not reconstruct environment values manually.

*Done when:* one fresh or same-session lab has one readable manifest and no unrelated lab was reused.

**Step 2: Verify the Handoff Contract**

1. Read `.agents/skills/eng/eng-qa-bootstrap/references/bootstrap-contract.md` in full.
2. Validate every required manifest field, env value, scratch-evidence file, provider-home policy, browser policy, audit command, and teardown command against that contract.
3. When a playbook was supplied, also validate the materialized playbook, agents, open-task tree, knowledge files, required deliverables/collaboration, and populated charter.
4. Treat scaffolding as empty evidence until downstream QA records real actions and the strict auditor passes.

*Done when:* manifest, env, paths, scenario contract, charter, playbook artifacts, and filesystem all describe the same isolated lab with no placeholders in a playbook run.

**Step 3: Hand Off to Downstream QA**

1. Pass `qa-docs-path=docs/qa` to `qa-report` and `qa-execution`; keep `QA_OUTPUT_PATH` as lab-side scratch evidence only.
2. Launch providers, Web, browser, and config operations exactly from the manifest contract. Preserve operator home for `native_cli + home_policy=operator`; use isolated provider homes for bound-secret or brokered lanes.
3. Export the manifest-derived `COMPOZY_WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET` for Web QA and serialize config writes against one isolated home.
4. Register every long-lived process immediately under `<QA_OUTPUT_PATH>/qa/pids/`.
5. Require downstream QA to run the manifest's strict `AUDIT_COMMAND` before a behavior-first verdict.

*Done when:* downstream skills consume the canonical manifest, durable findings land under `docs/qa/`, scratch evidence stays in the lab, and every owned process is registered.

**Step 4: Preserve Continuation State**

1. Report the manifest path, lab root, `COMPOZY_HOME`, base URL, dated run-report path, and reuse status.
2. For a continuing loop, append the exact machine-readable continuation block from the bootstrap contract.

*Done when:* the next continuation can identify the same lab from one exact manifest without discovery or guessing.

**Step 5: Tear Down on Every Terminal Path**

1. On PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED, or abort, run the manifest's exact `TEARDOWN_COMMAND`; only a confirmed continuation of the same loop may defer it.
2. The teardown must stop the daemon, tmux server, registered PIDs, lab-root processes, and lab-port listeners without touching unrelated labs.
3. Cite `<QA_OUTPUT_PATH>/qa/teardown.json` with `"clean": true`. Survivors are a blocking failure.
4. Reserve `make qa-reap` for intentional stale-lab recovery across the machine, not normal cleanup of one active run.

*Done when:* the current lab's teardown evidence is clean and no process owned by this pass remains alive.

## Error Handling

- **Requested reuse fails health checks:** use the fresh manifest emitted by the helper; do not revive stale state manually.
- **Provider reports global config errors:** compare the command's home policy with the manifest; isolated and operator-home lanes intentionally differ.
- **Web reaches the wrong daemon:** restart the Web process with the manifest-derived proxy target.
- **Teardown reports survivors:** inspect each `TEARDOWN_SURVIVOR`, stop only processes owned by the current lab, and rerun the same targeted teardown.
