# QA Bootstrap Contract

The bootstrap helper writes two canonical artifacts under:

`<qa-output-path>/qa/`

## Required files

- `bootstrap-manifest.json`
- `bootstrap.env`
- `scenario-contract.json`
- `behavioral-scenario-charter.yaml`
- `journey-log.jsonl`

## QA evidence contract files

- `scenario-contract.json` defines the release-grade minimums that downstream QA must satisfy before a `PASS` claim.
- An explicit `targeted` profile requires only its declared `--required-surface` values; it does not invent agent, channel, Task, artifact-reuse, disruption, or provider minimums for a bounded non-agent journey.
- `behavioral-scenario-charter.yaml` is JSON-compatible YAML. It must name the startup situation, operator intent, business outcome, agents, channels, task tree, provider plan, cross-surface targets, disruption probes, and artifacts. When `--playbook` was passed, the charter is materialized from the playbook spec and includes `playbook_ref`, `required_deliverables`, and `required_collaboration`.
- `journey-log.jsonl` is append-only structured evidence. Each meaningful CLI/API/Web/runtime/provider action must add one row.
- `provider-attempt.json` records live provider-backed proof or the exact blocked boundary. A blocked provider boundary supports a `BLOCKED` result, not a live-provider `PASS`.
- The auditor writes `qa-audit-report.json` and `qa-audit-report.md`; exit code `2` is a blocking QA failure.

## Playbook scaffolding (when --playbook is passed)

The bootstrap helper additionally writes the following under `WORKSPACE_PATH`:

- `.compozy/playbook.json` — the resolved playbook spec (the canonical structured JSON parsed from `references/playbooks/<ref>.md`).
- `.compozy/agents/<agent-id>.json` — one file per agent declared by the playbook (id, role, persona, system_prompt, workspace_id, workspace_path, skills, playbook_ref).
- `.compozy/tasks/open-tasks.json` — array of open tasks with deterministic `runtime_id`, owner_agent, owner_workspace_id, owner_workspace_path, deliverable_type, deliverable_path, review_required_by, channel, playbook_ref.
- `.compozy/disruption-seeds.json` — playbook disruption_probe_seeds for downstream consumers.
- `project/` — the only root registered with Compozy for agents under test; it excludes `qa-artifacts/`, manifests, audit contracts, and provider evidence.
- `project/workspaces/<workspace-name>/README.md` — per-workspace stub README.
- `knowledge/<...>` — canonical copy of every knowledge file declared by the playbook.
- `project/workspaces/<workspace-name>/knowledge/global/<...>` — every global knowledge file projected into each readable agent workspace.
- `project/workspaces/<workspace-name>/knowledge/<...>` — only the scoped knowledge files declared by that workspace.

`PLAYBOOK_REF` and `KICKOFF_POSTED=false` are written to the manifest env. `eng-real-scenario-qa` Step 4 flips `KICKOFF_POSTED=true` and sets `KICKOFF_TIMESTAMP` after posting the single in-persona kickoff.

## Reuse policy

- Default to a fresh lab for each new QA pass, even when an older lab exists for the same feature or scenario.
- Reuse a lab only when the caller passes the exact manifest path from the same active QA session or loop continuation.
- Repair that same-session lab in place before rebuilding when only derived files are missing.
- Rebuild when the requested manifest is missing, unreadable, or points at missing directories.

## Mandatory launch rules

- Bound-secret, brokered, or explicitly isolated-home provider commands: `HOME="$PROVIDER_HOME" CODEX_HOME="$PROVIDER_CODEX_HOME" <cmd>`
- `native_cli` providers with `home_policy=operator`: preserve the operator `HOME` / native login state unless the scenario explicitly validates isolated provider-home behavior
- Web dev server for isolated daemon QA: `COMPOZY_WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET="$COMPOZY_WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET" make web-dev`
- Config mutations such as `compozy config set` must run sequentially when they target the same isolated home.
- Before claiming behavior-first QA completion, run `python3 "$AUDIT_COMMAND" --qa-output-path "$QA_OUTPUT_PATH" --strict` and include its result in the verification report.
- Every long-lived process started against the lab (daemon, `make web-dev`, watchers, browser sessions started outside `agent-browser`'s own lifecycle) must register its PID at `<QA_OUTPUT_PATH>/qa/pids/<name>.pid` right after spawn (`echo $! > "$QA_OUTPUT_PATH/qa/pids/<name>.pid"`). The teardown consumes this registry first and falls back to cmdline/lsof/port scans.

## Mandatory teardown (process hygiene)

A QA pass is not complete while lab processes are alive. On every terminal path — pass, fail, blocked, or aborted — run:

```bash
eval "$TEARDOWN_COMMAND"            # single lab, from the manifest
# or, to reap every discoverable lab on the machine:
make qa-reap                         # add PURGE=1 to also delete runtime dirs after a clean sweep
```

- The teardown stops the daemon gracefully first (`compozy daemon stop` under the lab `COMPOZY_HOME`), kills the lab tmux server, then sweeps survivors (registered PIDs, cmdline references, lab-port listeners, open files under the runtime/provider homes).
- It writes `<QA_OUTPUT_PATH>/qa/teardown.json` and stamps a `teardown` block into the manifest. `"clean": true` in that block is the required completion evidence.
- Exception: a lab may stay alive ONLY while the same active session/loop continues using it (reuse policy above). A continuation that ends without reusing the lab inherits the teardown obligation.
- Exit code `1` (survivors remain) is a blocking failure: diagnose the survivors, do not ignore them.

## Machine-readable continuation block

Append this block to the end of a QA summary whenever a continuation may need to reuse the lab:

```text
[QA_BOOTSTRAP]
manifest_path=/abs/path/to/lab/qa-artifacts/qa/bootstrap-manifest.json
lab_root=/abs/path/to/lab
runtime_home=/abs/path/to/lab/.compozy/runtime
base_url=http://127.0.0.1:2235
verification_report=/abs/path/to/lab/qa-artifacts/qa/verification-report.md
health_status=healthy
[/QA_BOOTSTRAP]
```

Keep the keys exactly as shown so external loop tooling can parse them deterministically.
