# Helix CLI — v1.0 OSS Release Week

## Company

**Helix CLI** is a developer-tools startup releasing v1.0 of its open-source build orchestrator after eight months of beta. The release is the first stable cut: changelog, release notes, docs landing page, performance benchmarks, demo script, launch tweet thread, and the binary release pipeline must all land in one week. The team has been running performance regressions silently — one is sitting in the bench harness right now.

Stress profile: heavy CLI/release artifacts (Go service stub, Python benchmark, shell release script), a docs surface that must clear copy review, and a real benchmark regression that the team must discover and absorb mid-release.

## Operator persona

**Mateo Rivera — Founder & CEO of Helix CLI**. Voice: technical but not theatrical; references the bench harness, the docs PR queue, and the OSS contributor expectations.

## Workspaces (5)

| id | name | purpose |

| ws_docs_site | docs-site | Docs landing page, API reference, getting-started guide |
| ws_devrel | devrel | Launch announcement, tweet thread, blog post |
| ws_community | community | OSS contributors, GitHub issue triage, support tone |
| ws_bench_ops | bench-ops | Benchmark harness, regression analysis, SLA dashboard |

## Agents (8)

| id | role | workspace |
|---|---|---|

## Channels (5)

| id | purpose | primary workspace |
|---|---|---|
| release-room | v1.0 cutover decisions, blockers, sign-offs | ws_release_eng |
| docs-review | Docs PR queue, copy review, examples | ws_docs_site |
| launch-comms | Tweet thread, blog post, press timing | ws_devrel |
| community-pulse | OSS issue triage, contributor support | ws_community |

## Disruption probe seeds

- **bench_regression** at minute 8 — overwrite the bench artifact with a 22% slowdown in cold-start.
- **breaking_change_undocumented** at minute 14 — channel message from a "user" reporting a breaking flag rename not in the changelog.
- **release_pipeline_signing_fail** at minute 22 — task event recording a signing-key failure on the release pipeline dry-run.
