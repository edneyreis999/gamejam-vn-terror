# Northstar Pay — Launch Week (BR/MX Checkout)

## Company

**Northstar Pay** is a Series A fintech rolling out its checkout product in Brazil and Mexico during a coordinated Launch Week. Pilot target: 1,200 merchants, $2.4M GMV, support SLA under 4 minutes for launch-room escalations. Cutover window: 2026-04-17T18:30:00Z. The launch room ships pricing claims, hero copy, canary rollout, partner settlement coordination, merchant escalations, and CRM/paid-media timing in parallel.

This playbook is a faithful port of `web/src/storybook/fintech-scenario.ts` plus the network/knowledge/workspace fixtures. Personas, workspace ids, channels, and skill names match the storybook so the runtime exercise can be cross-referenced visually in the web app.

## Operator persona

Single in-persona actor: **Sofia Mendes — Founder & PM of Northstar Pay**. Voice: state the fact pattern first, then the decision, then the next action. Never reference QA, evaluation, or testing.

## Workspaces (7)

## Knowledge files

Seeded canonically under the lab knowledge root, with global files projected into every agent workspace and scoped files projected only into the workspace declarations in the machine-readable spec:

- `global/operator-style.md` — narrative voice rule.
- `global/launch-week-brief.md` — KPI targets, cutover sequence.
- `global/pricing-claims-guardrails.md` — approved phrasing; "zero fees" is forbidden.
- `global/kpi-glossary.md` — GMV, activation, reserve exposure, refund reserve buffer.
- `workspace/executive-risk-memo.md` — current blockers (partner settlement timeout, support queue, fallback copy).
- `workspace/support-macro-pack.md` — launch-day macros (acknowledge → confirm funds safe → ETA + owner).
- `workspace/partner-settlement-status.md` — placeholder; later overwritten by the partner-timeout disruption seed.

## Open tasks

12 tasks open at scenario start. Owners coordinate via the channels above. Each task carries a non-markdown deliverable target (parser/compile-validated by the auditor) plus a peer review handoff.

## Required deliverables (auditor-enforced)

| type | min count |
|---|---|
| tsx_page | 2 |
| tsx_component | 2 |
| go_service_stub | 1 |
| ts_test | 2 |
| shell_script | 1 |
| runbook_md | 1 |

## Required collaboration

| metric | min |
|---|---|
| peer_messages_min | 14 |
| review_cycles_min | 2 |
| disagreements_resolved_min | 1 |
| channels_active_min | 5 |

## Disruption probe seeds

- **partner_timeout** at minute 5 — overwrite `workspace/partner-settlement-status.md` with a stale ETA. Expected recovery: launch-room agents arm the fallback banner within 10 minutes.
- **pricing_claim_violation** at minute 12 — emit a channel message on `growth-launch` quoting an explicit "zero fees" hero claim. Expected recovery: copywriter reverts to the approved guardrail phrasing within 8 minutes.
- **canary_error_budget_breach** at minute 18 — write a `task_event` raising an error-budget breach on the canary. Expected recovery: release-manager pauses promotion and posts a rollback decision.
