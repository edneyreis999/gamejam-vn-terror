# Compozy Schema Migration

## Procedure

1. Read `references/migration-decision.md` and classify the changed datum and owning stream: `global` and `memory` share `compozy.db`; `session` owns each `events.db`; `workspace` owns workspace observability databases.
2. Inspect the owner's declarative schema source (`schema/schema.sql` or `schema/definitions/*.sql`), `schema/migrations/`, `schema/migrations/atlas.sum`, `migration_stream.go`, sqlc query catalog, and canonical migration/open tests. Select the next gap-free five-digit version. Never edit, rename, renumber, reorder, or delete an existing migration or its checksum entry.
3. Read `references/migration-template.md`. Edit the owning declarative source, then run `make codegen`. Inspect the newly appended Goose SQL, Atlas sqlcheck result, refreshed `atlas.sum`, and regenerated sqlc output. If the generated tail is wrong, correct the declarative schema and regenerate; add bounded data transformation SQL only to the unpublished tail, then rerun `make codegen`.
4. Update affected static queries in the owning sqlc catalog. Keep generated `sqlcgen` types inside the owner package and map them to domain types at the repository boundary.
5. Read `references/migration-test-patterns.md`. Extend the canonical suites for fresh apply, reopen with preserved data, ahead-version refusal, integrity failure, sequential history, and migrations-to-declarative-schema equivalence. When global or memory changes, also prove their shared-file table ownership remains disjoint.
6. If recovery or refusal guidance changes, move the whole stopped SQLite family (`.db`, `-wal`, `-shm`, and sibling databases) to cold storage; never move or edit one live file. Prefer a newer compatible binary for `schema_ahead` when state must be preserved.
7. Run scoped `-race` tests for the owning stream, `make codegen-check`, and `make lint`. Reserve one full `make verify` for the completion gate.

## Error Handling

- Stop on any `atlas.sum` mismatch or edited historical byte. Restore the exact unpublished history or append a new migration; never weaken validation or edit a Goose version table.
- Resolve destructive Atlas diagnostics in the design. Do not suppress sqlcheck to force generation.
- Document every greenfield hard cut and delete target in the spec/ADR. Do not ship aliases, dual schemas, or open-ended repair branches.
- Treat a pre-Goose marker as `legacy_database` and a recorded version above the embedded head as `schema_ahead`; neither condition authorizes in-place mutation.
